# Software development skills - Mobile project running guide

## by Jeremias Moberg

The project is functionally the same as the task 3 for coursework, but
each item in ListView has now 3 buttons to press and the item itself
is not a button. The button on the left works as info button and changes
activity to show the image shown in task 3 of the course work as well as
a description taken from wikipedia about the item. The second button ("-")
removes one item and the third button ("+") adds one item to the counter.
On the bottom of the screen the total price of the items selected is shown.

## Usage

1. Download the project
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Run the app from the button or press Shift+F10 if you have it as default
   to run the app
